# crud_operations
This project provides API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on a "model resource". A model represents an entity with properties like name,email,ID.

With these endpoints, we can perform common operations on the model:

Creating a new model object by providing the necessary data such as name,email,ID.
Retrieving all existing model objects. 
Retrieving a specific model object by its unique ID.
Updating a model object by providing new data. 
Deleting a model object by its ID
